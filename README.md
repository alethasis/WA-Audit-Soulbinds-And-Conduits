# Audit Soulbinds And Conduits

* Warns if current soulbind contains a different spec's conduits
* Set up specific soulbinds for a spec to warn if I have a different soulbind activated. Edit a specific class, rather than the entire group. (Inspired by Seiryoku's WA to auto-change soulbind on spec change -- https://wago.io/EgSrZ4mxS)
* I've since discovered a WA by Psyala#2192 that shows a similar table on ready check -- https://wago.io/tfKvHl-jk
